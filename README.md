ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Idrees 
==================

I'm a developer in the financial services industry. I mostly spend my time developing in TypeScript for the web and APIs. I have a particular interest in developing web and mobile applications and have been writing my first application in react native. I also have professional experience with Kotlin and Salesforce Apex and Administration.

I also have experience working with AWs; Implementing pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, Data Export Processed, etc.
